          <h3> Bolognese Sauce </h3>
          <p class="columntext">
            Bolognese is a hearty sauce that needs a toothy, wide noodle like fresh pappardelle, or a sturdy dried shape like rigatoni. Best served with a glass of Italian red wine, this boolgnese is rich and meaty. </p>

            <p class="columntext">Bite-size pieces of cauliflower blend seamlessly into this four-cheese crowd-pleaser while cherry tomatoes add a welcome, refreshing brightness. Served either for lunch and/or for dinner, this dish is bet served with a glass of white wine. </p>

            <h3> Pasta with Mushrooms and Prosciutto </h3>
            <p class="columntext">Getting the consistency of the creamy mushroom sauce right is key for this pasta recipe. You want to reduce it just until it clings to the pasta to create a light coating; be careful not to reduce it too much.</p>

          <p class="columntext">A generous dash of crushed red pepper cuts through the sweet, rich tomato-cream sauce of this Italian-American classic. The taste of the tomato sauce is delicious as it is preppered with a variety of fresh spices and herbs. This dish is recommended with either a glass of white or red wine. </p>

          <p class="columntext"> Individual servings of stuffed shells make an impressive presentation. If you have enough individual baking dishes, divide the shells and sauce among them, then top with cheese, keeping in mind that you might need a little more cheese to top individual servings than is called for in the recipe.</p>
